What is EMASE-Zero?

EMASE-Zero is a software program written in C++ to quantify allele-specific
expression and gene expression simultaneously from RNA-seq data.

EMASE-Zero takes in one of two file formats as input.  One is a custom file
format, which is constructed from the diploid transcriptome alignment BAM file
and two text files containing transcript names and to transcript to gene mapping
information using the provided bam_to_pcl.py script. See bam_to_pcl.py --help
for more information.  The second file format is a binary file generated from
a modified version of Kallisto (a program for quantifying abundances of 
transcripts from RNA-Seq data) called kallisto-export.  Input files produced by
kallisto-export are now the preferred format. 

kallisto-export is available here:
    https://github.com/churchill-lab/kallisto-export

Some normalization models require gene to transcript mapping information. This 
information can be added into the .pcl.bz file, or passed on the command line
using the --gene-mappings (-g) option. This option takes a filename as an
argument and the file has one tab separated line per gene where the first field
is the gene ID and all remaining fields are transcript IDs that belong to that
gene. With the Kallisto binary file, this command line option is the only way to 
specify gene to transcript mappings. It is an error if the gene mapping file 
contains a transcript name not present in the input file, or if it is missing a
transcript that is present in the input file. 

EMASE-Zero can also adjust for transcript length. To use this feature, you would
pass a file containing the length of each transcript for each haplotype. The 
format of each line is 'TranscriptName_HaplotypeName\tlenght'

EMASE-Zero, a C++ version of EMASE, is still under development and is based on
the Python prototype of EMASE which is available here:

To Do
-----

EMASE-Zero is still under development.  Here are some of the things we have
planned:

 * multi-threading
 * better packaging and installation
 * improved error checking
 * improved documentation

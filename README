What is EMASE2?

EMASE2 is a software program written in C++ to quantify allele-specific
expression and gene expression simultaneously from RNA-seq data.

EMASE2 takes in one of two file formats as input.  One is a custom file format,
which is constructed from the diploid transcriptome alignment BAM file and two
text files containing transcript names and to transcript to gene mapping
information using the provided bam_to_pcl.py script. See bam_to_pcl.py --help
for more information.  The second file format is a binary file generated from
Kallisto (a program for quantifying abundances of transcripts from RNA-Seq data)
output.  

The Kallisto exporter is available here:

Kallisto is here:

EMASE2, a C++ version of EMASE, is still under development and is based on
the Python prototype of EMASE which is available here:
https://github.com/churchill-lab/emase

The README for the original Python version can be found here:

To Do
-----

EMASE2 is still under development.  Here are some of the things we have
planned:

 * multi-threading
 * better packaging and installation
 * improved error checking
 * improved documentation

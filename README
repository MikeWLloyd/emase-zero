What is EMASE2?

EMASE2 is a software program written in C++ to quantify allele-specific
expression and gene expression simultaneously from RNA-seq data.  EMASE2
takes in a custom file format as input, which is constructed from the
diploid transcriptome alignment BAM file and two text files containing
transcript to gene mapping information using the provided bam_to_pcl.py
script.

EMASE2, a C++ version of EMASE, is still under development and is based on
the Python prototype of EMASE which is available here:
https://github.com/churchill-lab/emase

The README for the original Python version can be found here:

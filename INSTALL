EMASE2 INSTALL

Building and installing EMASE2 requires a C++ compiler and Python 2.7.
Python is required to load data from the input file format, which
consists of several Pickled Python data structures. The TranscriptHits
Python module requires pysam, numpy, and scipy.

Compilation:

cd src
make

This will create an executable called emase2 in the src directory. You
can copy this executable into your desired bin directory (such as
/usr/local/bin)

In order to execute emase2, the Python interpreter needs to be able to
load the TranscriptHits module.  You can either add the path to the
directory containing the TranscriptHits.py file to PYTHONPATH, or you
can use the included setup.py script to install the Python module.  This
will also install two utility scripts, bam_to_pcl.py and pcl_info.py,
which are used create and view the pcl.bz2 input files for emase2.

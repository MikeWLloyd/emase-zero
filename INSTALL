EMASE2 INSTALL

Building and installing EMASE2 requires a C++ compiler and Python 2.7. Python 
is required to load data from one input file format, which consists of several
Pickled Python data structures. The TranscriptHits Python module requires pysam,
numpy, and scipy.  While Python support is compiled in, emase2 only needs to 
load the TranscriptHits Python module if you use the "pcl.bz" input file format. 
The other supported file format does not require access to this Python module 
at runtime. 

Compilation:

cd src
make

This will create an executable called emase2 in the src directory. You
can copy this executable into your desired bin directory (such as
/usr/local/bin)

In order to load the "pcl.bz" input format, the Python interpreter needs to be 
able to load the TranscriptHits module, which is located in the "python"
subdirectory.  You can either add the path to the directory containing the
TranscriptHits.py file to PYTHONPATH, or you can use the included setup.py
script to install the Python module.  This will also install two utility
scripts, bam_to_pcl.py and pcl_info.py, which are used create and view the
pcl.bz2 input files for emase2.

If you do not intend to use the "pcl.bz" file format,  then emase2 does not 
need to load the TranscriptHits module.
